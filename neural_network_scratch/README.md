# Neural Network From Scratch


This project involded combining my knowledge from linear algebra and multivariable calculus in order to create a fully functional nueral network
from scratch, which was then trained on the XOR logic gate.


### Description

Matrix math and manipulation was handeled by Numpy, and the dataset was handeled with Pandas.



### Challeneges

The hardest part of this project was implemented gradient descent updates and keeping track of all the correct gradients for every node during debugging.
