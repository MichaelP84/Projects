# Capstone Research Paper

The goal of this project was to create a paper about any research project inside a niche in the research feild. In this case, I wrote about using the Random Forest Model to analyze and predict Twitch streamer rankings.

### Description

The Random Forest Model was implemented in Tensorflow, using a grid search to tune the parameters of the model, and Pandas handled the dataset.


### Challenges

The most challenging part of this research project was situating my research in the context of research already in the field. Reading published papers about everythig from Twitch streaming to machine learning--and machine learning used on Twitch streams--took the majority of my time.
Moreover, in writing the paper, I needed to explain topics in a way that was accessible to any undergraduate student, per the requirements of the research. This led me to new understanding of the random forest model which I was able to convey to a board during my presentation and oral defense.
